Donkey Kong Clone on Bare Metal Raspberry Pi
Welcome to the Donkey Kong Clone project! This project is a unique and exciting take on the classic Donkey Kong game, brought to life on a bare metal Raspberry Pi. With no operating system in place, we directly interact with the hardware, showcasing our deep understanding of low-level programming and hardware interfacing.

Project Overview

Features:

Bare Metal Execution: Our Donkey Kong clone runs directly on the Raspberry Pi without an operating system, demonstrating efficient use of hardware resources and low-level programming techniques.

Custom Graphics Rendering: The game is displayed on a monitor via the Raspberry Pi’s graphics hardware, with custom drivers handling the rendering of game graphics.

SNES Controller Integration: We've integrated an SNES controller for user input, writing custom drivers to translate button presses into game actions.


Technical Highlights:

Bare Metal Programming: By operating without an OS, we've bypassed system calls, directly managing hardware resources. This approach demands meticulous attention to detail and a solid grasp of Raspberry Pi's architecture.

Custom Graphics Driver: We developed a custom graphics driver to render the game's visuals. This driver interacts directly with the Raspberry Pi’s GPU, ensuring smooth and efficient display performance.

Controller Driver Development: To interpret SNES controller inputs, we wrote custom drivers that convert button presses into actionable game controls. This required an in-depth understanding of both the SNES controller protocol and the Raspberry Pi’s input/output capabilities.

As running this project is very niche and requires many components I have attached a video made by my partner showcasing our project, thank you for checking out our project!
